- Players take turns to enter a number from 1 to 9 corresponding to the grid position where they want to place their token (either 'x' or '0').
- The first player to align three of their tokens in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
- If all positions are filled and no player has aligned three tokens, the game ends in a draw.
